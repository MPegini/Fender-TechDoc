            <p>Your bass guitar is solidly built with the best
                materials and craftsmanship. As part of its
                final assembly, we’ve hand-adjusted it and
                set it up to Fender® factory specs, which
                give you the best possible playing action.
                Like all instruments made of wood, your bass
                may have experienced moderate changes
                brought about by exposure to different
                temperatures and humidity levels. This
                happens naturally with time and with changes
                in your instrument’s geographic location.</p>
            <code></code>
            <p>The exact condition of the playing action can be affected by:</p>
            <li>Amount of time between final assembly and shipping from Fender</li>
            <li>Amount of time between shipping from Fender and arrival at shipping destination.
            </li>
            <li>Method of shipment—e.g., trucking, shipping, airfreight, etc.</li>
            <li>Climate conditions during transportation.</li>
            <li>Climate conditions at shipping destination.</li>
            <li>Climate conditions at dealer before purchase.</li>

            <img src="assets/images/bassplayingaction.png">
            <p>When you first get your bass guitar, don’t
                be alarmed if the playing action is no longer
                set to exact factory specs. It is natural for an
                instrument’s setup to change due to the factors
                just listed. Your bass is designed to include many
                adjustment points that allow you to compensate
                for changes that might have taken place after
                final assembly but before you received it, or
                to simply customize the instrument to fit your
                personal preferred playing style. If the action
                is higher or lower than you prefer, for example,
                this manual describes how to set up, adjust and
                maintain your bass so that its playing condition
                is optimal for you. Of course, if you’d rather not
                adjust it yourself, you can always take your bass
                to an Authorized Fender Service Center for help.</p>

            <p>Initial standard setup and adjustment of an
                instrument and its parts at time of purchase are
                considered normal dealer product preparation
                and are not covered by the Fender warranty.
                On receipt and acceptance of the instrument,
                the consumer assumes all responsibility
                for setup, adjustment and maintenance.</p>

            <p>Fender
                ® offers basses with passive electronics
                (no batteries) and basses with active
                (battery-powered) preamps. Depending on
                the instrument, your active bass may have
                either a 9-volt (one-battery) system, or
                an 18-volt (two-battery) system. Visit the
                Knowledge Base in the Support section of
                www.fender.com, where the service diagrams
                link presents detailed information on more
                than 250 Fender instrument models.</p>
            <code></code>
            <p>Typical battery life for both systems is
                approximately 600 hours of playing time.
                All Fender basses with active preamps are
                equipped with switching jacks that engage the
                battery when a cable is plugged into the jack.
                To maximize battery life, unplug your cable from
                the bass when not playing the instrument. As
                batteries lose power, the voltage supplied to
                the preamp will drop, resulting in distortion and</p>
            <p>unwanted noise that indicate that the batteries
                must be changed (note that active basses
                without an active/passive switch will not operate
                in passive mode when the batteries are dead).
                For basses with two-battery 18-volt preamps,
                always replace both batteries at the same time,
                as mismatched voltages may adversely affect
                the performance of the preamp. It is a good idea
                to use the same brand of battery consistently.</p>

                THIS LIMITED WARRANTY.
                Fender has established a network of independent
                Authorized Fender Service Centers for warranty
                service. The Fender Dealer from whom you
                purchased your instrument may also be authorized
                for warranty service and should be the first
                point of contact when service of any kind is
                required for your Fender instrument. To receive
                warranty service, return the complete instrument
                to an Authorized Fender Service Center, with
                your sales receipt as proof of purchase, during
                the applicable warranty period. Defective
                components that qualify for coverage under this
                warranty will be repaired or replaced (at Fender’s
                discretion) without charge. Remedies beyond
                normal service repair of any Fender instrument
                require both an evaluation and confirmation
                of the defect and a direct recommendation
                to Fender from an Authorized Fender Service
                Center for alternative considerations.
                All transportation, insurance and freight charges
                associated with warranty service and repairs
                on Fender instruments are the responsibility of

                purpose of customizing setups or adjustments
                beyond factory specifications. Initial standard
                setup and adjustment of the instrument and
                its components at the time of purchase are
                considered normal Dealer product preparation
